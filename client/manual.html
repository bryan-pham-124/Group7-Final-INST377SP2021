            <h1>Known Bugs and Future Development</h1>

                    <h3>Bugs</h3>

                    <li>Sometimes it can take awhile to update or post entries on the database.This could possibly be due to slow internet issues.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes all foods on the database cannot be displayed on the “All foods available” front end component. 
                        This can happen if a user enters a new entry in the database and then immediately refreshes the page</li>

                    <h3>Future Development</h3>
                    
                    <li>For each item displayed, also display their nutrient content</li>
                    <li>Get the menus and info of nearby restaurants, add them to the meals database and display the menus to users on the app</li>
                    <li> Add a feature where users can post reviews of foods in the database</li>
                    <li> Add a user profiling and favoriting feature, where users have their own user profile and be able to “favorite” restaurants they like</li>
                    <li> Include a map of all the dining location as a visual aspect</li>
